## The Past of the Progenitors

The story begins in the ancient past of the galaxy, so old that no one in Bentus can remember.

 

A long-range expedition fleet arrived at the galaxy. The had very advanced technology which was just like pure magic. They met two indigenous races here, one was the Bentusi and the other was the T-MAT. The Bentusi lived in the galactic disc, and had just been able to carry out space activities around their mother planet Bentus. The T-MAT lived in the companion galaxy next to the galactic disc and had just entered the space age. The expedition fleet had made some contacts with Bentusi and T-MATians, helping them to quickly improve their technology and let them learn the knowledge and skills of hyperspace so they could roam the Galaxy.

 

The expedition fleet had planned to just stop here for a while, but then it seemed that something had happened to them, and they decided not to go forward or return to their homeland, but to stay in the galaxy and settle down. They began to call themselves the Progenitors. At this time, because of the advances in space technology, the Bentusi began to leave their planet and become interstellar nomads. They began to live on spaceships all their lives, selling low-tech, cheap and consumable goods to the Progenitors. And the T-MAT had unified the companion galaxy.

 

The unification of the companion galaxy by the T-MAT was opposed by the Progenitors. As an expedition fleet from a highly developed civilization, when they traveled in the universe and met other civilizations, the Progenitors always held the following principles: for those civilizations that could not leave their own planet, they were absolutely prohibited from contacting them, so as not to affect their normal development and evolution; for those civilizations that had entered the stage of space flight or early space age, they could have limited contacts and moderately help them to improve their civilization; for civilizations whose level of science and technology was similar to their own, they should communicate equally with them. Therefore, after arriving at this galaxy, the Progenitors gave a little support to Bentusi and T-MAT, but did not make any contact with dozens of civilizations in the galaxy which are still in the lower stage, and warned Bentussi and T-MAT not to violate the rules of the Progenitors.

 

The Bentusi listened well to the Progenitors, while the T-MAT complied in appearance but opposed in heart. Since there is a wide space between the companion galaxy and the galactic disc where the cosmic constants are abnormal and cannot be jumped through, the only means to travel between the galactic disc and the companion galaxy is through the huge portal - Eye of Aarran which was built by the Progenitors in the black hole cluster Balcora. Even the Progenitors felt inconvenient to go to the companion galaxy, thus the T-MAT did whatever they wanted in the companion galaxy, wiping out the five civilizations that were still in the feudal and early capitalist societies. Then they sneaked into the galactic disc and destroyed several low-level civilizations without the Progenitors knowing it.

 

At this time, the Progenitors discovered the violent nature of the T-MAT, and decided to limit their range of activity to the companion galaxy. Of course, if they were not bound by their own code of conduct, the angry Progenitors were likely to do what the T-MAT do to those low-level civilizations to destroy all T-MATians. With the Progenitors’ high technology, they could easily eliminate T-MAT if they want.

 

On the one hand, the T-MATians were afraid of the Progenitors’ advanced technology; on the other hand, they could not resist their ambition to dominate the galaxy. So they had to lurk in the companion galaxy, waiting for the Progenitors to make mistakes.

 

Meanwhile, the Bentusi was a peaceful race. They combined their ancient philosophy with the Progenitors’ rules of treating alien civilizations, forming two philosophical concepts of "adherence" and "restraint". They became loyal friends the Progenitors.

 

No matter how civilized a race is, there will be a day when it makes mistakes. The Progenitors fell into a civil war. The fuse is the mysterious disappearance of a weak inertial propulsion experience ship called the Naggarok. At that time, the contradiction between the quantum correspondents and the normal people of the Progenitors had become more and more fierce. The disappearance of the Naggarok provided an excuse for the quantum correspondents to start a rebellion. The peaceful prosperity of the Progenitors had gone, and the vicious civil war broke out. The intensity of the war was beyond the imagination of the Bentusi and the T-MAT, and the battlefield ran through the entire galaxy.

Though once omniscient like God, the Progenitors were now thrown into chaos, and the Bentusi was also at a loss. But the T-MAT finally waited for their own opportunity. They sneaked out of the Eye of Aarran, while avoiding the chaotic civil war of the Progenitors, began to apply their evil plan to every indigenous race in the galactic disc including the Bentusi. Finally, all the native civilizations in the galactic disc were wiped out by the T-MAT, except for the Bentusi, whose technology is comparable to that of the T-MAT. But the Bentusi mother planet, Bentus, was also destroyed. Of course, the Bentusi have already moved out of Bentusi many years before. At this time, their home in their heart is the great mother harbor of Bentus.

 

As the Progenitors civil war became more and more fierce, some Progenitors began to rethink on it.
