# Background setting of "Crossroads among the stars"

## 1. The Past of the Progenitors

The story begins in the ancient past of the galaxy, so old that no one in Bentus can remember.

A long-range expedition fleet arrived at the galaxy. The had very advanced technology which was just like pure magic. They met two indigenous races here, one was the Bentusi and the other was the Tmat. The Bentusi lived in the galactic disc, and had just been able to carry out space activities around their mother planet Bentus. The Tmat lived in the companion galaxy next to the galactic disc and had just entered the space age. The expedition fleet had made some contacts with Bentusi and Tmatians, helping them to quickly improve their technology and let them learn the knowledge and skills of hyperspace so they could roam the Galaxy.

The expedition fleet had planned to just stop here for a while, but then it seemed that something had happened to them, and they decided not to go forward or return to their homeland, but to stay in the galaxy and settle down. They began to call themselves the Progenitors. At this time, because of the advances in space technology, the Bentusi began to leave their planet and become interstellar nomads. They began to live on spaceships all their lives, selling low-tech, cheap and consumable goods to the Progenitors. And the Tmat had unified the companion galaxy.

The unification of the companion galaxy by the Tmat was opposed by the Progenitors. As an expedition fleet from a highly developed civilization, when they traveled in the universe and met other civilizations, the Progenitors always held the following principles: for those civilizations that could not leave their own planet, they were absolutely prohibited from contacting them, so as not to affect their normal development and evolution; for those civilizations that had entered the stage of space flight or early space age, they could have limited contacts and moderately help them to improve their civilization; for civilizations whose level of science and technology was similar to their own, they should communicate equally with them. Therefore, after arriving at this galaxy, the Progenitors gave a little support to Bentusi and Tmat, but did not make any contact with dozens of civilizations in the galaxy which are still in the lower stage, and warned Bentusi and Tmat not to violate the rules of the Progenitors.

The Bentusi listened well to the Progenitors, while the Tmat complied in appearance but opposed in heart. Since there is a wide space between the companion galaxy and the galactic disc where the cosmic constants are abnormal and cannot be jumped through, the only means to travel between the galactic disc and the companion galaxy is through the huge portal - Eye of Aarran which was built by the Progenitors in the black hole cluster Balcora. Even the Progenitors felt inconvenient to go to the companion galaxy, thus the Tmat did whatever they wanted in the companion galaxy, wiping out the five civilizations that were still in the feudal and early capitalist societies. Then they sneaked into the galactic disc and destroyed several low-level civilizations without the Progenitors knowing it. (The Eye of Aarran was also the hub of the entire galaxy transportation network, through which people could quickly travel to any parts of the galaxy, with hyperspace cores used as power source.)

At this time, the Progenitors discovered the violent nature of the Tmat, and decided to limit their range of activity to the companion galaxy. Of course, if they were not bound by their own code of conduct, the angry Progenitors were likely to do what the Tmat do to those low-level civilizations to destroy all Tmatians. With the Progenitors’ high technology, they could easily eliminate Tmat if they want.

On the one hand, the Tmatians were afraid of the Progenitors’ advanced technology; on the other hand, they could not resist their ambition to dominate the galaxy. So they had to lurk in the companion galaxy, waiting for the Progenitors to make mistakes.

Meanwhile, the Bentusi was a peaceful race. They combined their ancient philosophy with the Progenitors’ rules of treating alien civilizations, forming two philosophical concepts of "adherence" and "restraint". They became loyal friends the Progenitors.

No matter how civilized a race is, there will be a day when it makes mistakes. The Progenitors fell into a civil war. The fuse is the mysterious disappearance of a weak inertial propulsion experience ship called the Naggarok. At that time, the contradiction between the quantum correspondents and the normal people of the Progenitors had become more and more fierce. The disappearance of the Naggarok provided an excuse for the quantum correspondents to start a rebellion. The peaceful prosperity of the Progenitors had gone, and the vicious civil war broke out. The intensity of the war was beyond the imagination of the Bentusi and the Tmat, and the battlefield ran through the entire galaxy.

Though once omniscient like God, the Progenitors were now thrown into chaos, and the Bentusi was also at a loss. But the Tmat finally waited for their own opportunity. They sneaked out of the Eye of Aarran, while avoiding the chaotic civil war of the Progenitors, began to apply their evil plan to every indigenous race in the galactic disc including the Bentusi. Finally, all the native civilizations in the galactic disc were wiped out by the Tmat, except for the Bentusi, whose technology is comparable to that of the Tmat. But the Bentusi mother planet, Bentus, was also destroyed. Of course, the Bentusi have already moved out of Bentusi many years before. At this time, their home in their heart is the great mother harbor of Bentus.

As the Progenitors civil war became more and more fierce, some Progenitors began to rethink on it.



## 2. Preparation for the Reconstruction of Civilization

A man named Sajuuk predicted that after a long and devastating civil war, the Progenitor civilization would be destroyed, and it was likely that the survivors would return to a very low level of civilization. In order to rebuild the Progenitor civilization after the war, he organized a group of like-minded people to start a civilization rescue plan called "Spark". According to the plan, they hid the battleship of Sajuuk in the depths of Balcora, then stored information about the Progenitor civilization into its engine system - the three hyperspace cores, and then hid them in three different locations in the galaxy. If future generations can redevelop space technology and find these hyperspace cores, they will be able to get part of the records and lessons from the Progenitors. And who collects the three hyperspace cores will be able to restart the battleship of Sajuuk and obtain complete knowledge of the Progenitors’ history, technology and wisdom from the ship's database. On their way to Balcora, they kept sending their crew members down to any planet suitable for human habitation in the hope that they could reproduce on these planets, escape the war and rebuild civilization.

Sayuk was regarded as a traitor because he broke away from his original faction for the Spark plan. Some others heard of the Spark plan and knew that he had hidden a latest warship and wanted to seize it. So Sajuuk and his friends were chased after and attacked by many different factions. During those battles, the shipyard that built the battleship of Sajuuk was destroyed, with debris scattered throughout the galaxy. Two dreadnoughts which were used as guides to open the door to Sajuuk were also missing.

Finally, Sajuuk completed his plan. The Progenitors finally dried up their last drop of blood, and the whole civilization went back to the lowest stage. Some people were trapped on the planets and returned to primitive society. Some people were trapped in the space stations or space ships; while they could still access and use these high-tech products, they lost their science and technology, and they only know how to use, but not how to develop those products. The crew members of Sajuuk who were sent down during the way to Balcora were not able to escape the scourge of the war, and survivors from them also returned to the primitive society.

Some Progenitors tried to save the civilization in another way, called the "Soul Project". They quantized their bodies and stored them in a database in the hope of preserving their memories and knowledge and rebuilding the glorious civilization in the future.

Before the destruction of the Progenitor civilization, some people finally discovered the action of Tmat. They drove them back to the companion galaxy with the last breath of strength, then closed the Eye of Aarran. They also build two artificial planets beside the Eye of Aarran, named the Great Wall and the Hadrian, as the guardians and barriers to prevent the Tmat from bringing disasters after the destruction of the Progenitor civilization, and also to prevent their descendants from rashly reopening the Eye of Aarran and bringing their enemies. (However, Sajuuk didn't know about this last effort, so in his plan, if their descendants find the battleship of Sajuuk, they should restart the Eye of Aarran in order to reopen the transportation network and prosper in the galaxy. We will soon see what consequences would this have for the second generation of civilization.)

With the help of the Progenitors, the Bentusi eventually drove away the Tmatians. Since then, the Progenitor civilization had collapsed. As loyal friends and worshippers of their the Progenitors, the Bentusi has made up their minds to help the Progenitor’s descendants rise again.

They happened to find one of the three hyperspace cores of Sajuuk, and mounted it on the Bentus. 



## 3. Bentusi the Guardian

Since then, more than two thousand years have passed.

The descendants of the Progenitors had forgotten their previous civilization. They had gone through the ages of blood, slavery and feudalism, muskets and steam, gas engines and electronics on their own planet, or they had been driving their ancestors' high-tech machines with ignorant minds in spaceships and space stations. Sajuuk became their legendary god or demon (depending on which Progenitors faction they were descended from); the three hyperspace cores to rediscover the Progenitor civilization became "the one who collects the three holy things will become the Sajuuk-Khar - the Chosen One"; the restart of the battleship of Sajuuk also became the myth of "Sajuuk will return to the world". It was believed by some anti-Sajuuk Progenitors that Sajuuk hid his warship to launch a strategic counter-attack and defeat them, so their descendants have formed such a legend that "Sajuuk's return will bring the doomsday and catastrophes".

During this period, the Bentusi adhered to the principles of the Progenitors and did not contact them.

Until one day, the descendants of the Progenitors on planets invented their own rockets and flew into the space; the descendants of the Progenitors on spaceships no longer treat the ship as a fetich and started inventing and creating by themselves. Bentusi then began visiting them one by one, bringing back the knowledge of hyperspace they learned from the Progenitors. Forgetting the history of their ancestors, people just thought the Bentusi was an high-tech alien race, and this historical event is called "Bentusi Arrival".

Later, the descendants of the Progenitors returned to the galaxy as "different civilizations".

For 500 years, people lived in peace under the glory of Bentusi. But with the development of technology and the enlargement of people’s vision, they started an uprising against Bentusi. This part of history is detailed in the appendix of the official Homeworld 2 booklet.

The descendants of the Progenitors thought each other as aliens and different species and civilizations. They call themselves Taiidani, Hiigarans, Charazers, Fronians, Red-Rings, and so on.

After the Hiigarans were exiled to Kharak, what happened was the plot of Homeworld 1. The second hyperspace core was discovered on Kharak, and the Hiigarans returned to their homeworld, Hiigara.

Thereafter, the Taiidan Empire was overthrown and the Republic of Taiidan was founded. But the greedy Galactic Council had always wanted to completely destroy the Titan world, and the Hiigrans also wanted to take back the territory that the Titans had taken from their ancestors after knowing the history of their ancestral empire. Later, the cataclysm of beast broke out. Although the whole galaxy finally survived the cataclysm, the political situation became worse and worse. Finally, the war broke out, which was called "the Dust War". In the Dust War, the Galactic Council was disintegrated, and every country was at war with each other. People recall the old myth and also call the Dust War "War of the End Time", which is also considered the Galaxy War III. (the Galaxy War I was the war when every race was trying to expand but was suppressed by the Bentusi by force. Followed by Galaxy War I was a period of peace for hundreds of years. Then came the Galaxy War II, which is also called "Pan-Galaxy Uprising", during which several major race launched wars at the same time in different parts of the Galaxy. After this war, Bentusi’s control over the galaxy was loosened; the Galactic Council was founded and Bentusi’s influence over the galaxy was limited in commerce.) The Hiigrans took advantage of this opportunity and began to devour the space of the Taiidani world. The political structure of Taiidani Republic, which was never stabilized, had been shaking gradually and finally collapsed. At this time, a minority of ethnic group in Taiidani territory called Vaygr appeared on the stage of history under the slogan of "Unifying the Taiidani World".

## 5. Hiigara Hegemonism

Karan’s dormancy caused a bit of confusion to Hiigarans, but because of the appearance of a self-proclaimed electronic soul of a Progenitor named "Celestial Star" and the lessons coming from the constant suffering since the Homeworld War, the Hiigaran quickly restored order. With the victory of the legendary " War of the End", and becoming the legendary "Sajuuk-khar - the Chosen One", The self-satisfaction and pride of Hiigarans began to swell, and they began to declare that " The Age of S'jet has begun".

When they defeated the Vaygr, Hiigaran had the highest prestige in the galaxy. Many races and nations stood beside Hiigaran in the hope of bringing peace to the galaxy. However, as time went on, the "sense of obligation" in Hiigarans’ mind, which had been at a normal level, expanded to a "sense of superiority". With the Celestial Star stirring up the flames, the Hiigarans began to think that all other races’s inability to resist the Vaygr could prove that Hiigaran civilization and culture are the best in the galaxy. All the myth are realized in their hands, so the galaxy should be unified under the leadership of Hiigaran. All “good” races in the galaxy should follow the trend, learn from Hiigaran culture, act in accordance with Hiigaran code of conduct, and enter the international order advocated by Hiigarans. Therefore, the Greate Unified Galaxy Organization was established, whose purpose is to assimilate the whole galaxy with Hiigaran life style and ideas.

Inevitably, the Hiigarans began to demand that other races adopt Hiigaran way of thinking, moral standards and codes of conduct, otherwise they would be reprimanded as dissidents, scoundrels and villains.

As a result, Hiigarans’s image among the various races in the galaxy began to deteriorate, and Hiigarans’s action to unify the galaxy was greatly hindered. More and more frequently, they used force to oppress others to yield to them. This kind of imperialist hegemonism aroused people's disgust, which was used by the mysterious " Progenitor souls" in different nations to incite dissatisfaction with Hiigara, and finally turned into a revolt. Under the interpretation of the Celestial Star, the rebellion was regarded by the Hiigarans as an alien nationalism ideology and was further suppressed, which further intensified the contradictions.
